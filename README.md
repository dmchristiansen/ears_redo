# ears_redo
Recreation of Mutable Instruments' Ears (https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/tree/master/ears/hardware_design) done in KiCad.

This is redone with 0603 components instead of 0402.  KiCad's function for importing schematics from Eagle doesn't work very well for the PCB art on the front panel.
Also, I wanted to practice layout a more compact board than I've done in the past.
